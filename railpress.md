RailPress is a modular, open-source content management system built with Ruby on Rails 8, inspired by the architecture and flexibility of WordPress. Designed for developers who prefer modern Rails conventions over bloated or outdated systems, RailPress focuses on simplicity, extensibility, and customization. It includes built-in support for theming, plugin architecture, and custom content types, making it easy to tailor for blogs, marketing sites, documentation portals, and more.

At its core, RailPress supports content pages, services, events, and image attachments. It includes Stimulus.js for interactive frontend features and uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design. Developers can easily scaffold new modules, and merchants or content editors benefit from a clean, intuitive interface.

What sets RailPress apart is its built-in update engine—similar to WordPress—allowing administrators to pull changes directly from a GitHub repository and apply updates across the codebase without downtime. This feature is especially useful for self-hosted instances that require security patches or feature enhancements without manual redeployment.

Whether you're building a site for a client, launching a startup landing page, or maintaining internal tools, RailPress offers a Rails-native alternative to bulky CMS platforms. It’s lightweight, fast, and developer-focused—ideal for those who want full control over their stack without sacrificing ease of use.
